When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When there are multiple contributors for the project and to save the project if in there is any mishappening.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I want to pull changes before i review that the changes must not have a bug in them otherwise, my whole code will change.
