How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	It'll help to identify the changes that i've made between the old versiona and the new version.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	It'll help to see the progress of the project and still have the rights to go back to the older version
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
	Pros are that it'll save that version which i want to save and have the right to go back whenever i want. Cons are if i forget to save the file then the data will be lost and progress in the prjoec will be slow
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	It is done to have the whole history of the programme to be saved so that the programmer can go back to the older version at amy time.
